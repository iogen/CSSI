  <h2>Family</h2>
  <h5 class="aaa"> Siblings </h5>
    <p>Jeremie has 4 siblings. An older brother and sister and a younger brother and sister. He's living the life being the middle child.</p>
  <h5> Parents </h5>
    <p> Jeremie was born to Omoregie and Adesuwa Osaghae-Nosa.
  <h5>Childhood</h5>
    <p>Jeremie's family relocated when he was at the age of three. He grew up hearing a multitude of languages. Six in total, but seldom remembers these langauges. Living in Germany for the first 3 years of his life he was filled with German. However, he grew to hate Spanish and French the more his parents regularly spoke it. Completly the opposite of his older siblings who still can speak French and Spanish. After relocating to the United States at three, he also had very short briefs living stints in the city of Atlanta, New York, Chicago, and Dallas. He never claims them because living for less than a year does not give you the right to truly say you lived there. They finally settled down in St. Louis at the age of 6. It wasn't until he was 15 years old that he revisited Nigeria and reconnected with family members he has never seen before.
